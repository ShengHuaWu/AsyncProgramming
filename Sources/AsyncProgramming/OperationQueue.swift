// Conclusions:
//
// 1. Operation does not provide async non-blocking.
//    There is no way to give up our operation’s resources to another operation
//    if we are waiting for something, such as a delay, timer or network request.
//
// 2. Operation coordination does not work well with cancellation
//
// 3. Operation API is heavily OOP design
//
// 4. Operation does not avoid multithread race condition

// Conclusions:
//
// 1. Threads don’t support the notion of child threads so that things
// like priority, cancellation, and thread dictionaries
// don’t trickle down to threads created from other threads.
//
// 2. It’s easy to accidentally explode the number of threads being used.
//
// 3. It’s hard to coordinate between threads.
//
// 4. Threaded code looks very different from unthreaded code.
//
// 5. The tools for synchronizing between threads are crude.
